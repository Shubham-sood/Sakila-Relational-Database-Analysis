#Introduction

In this project, we have queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs.
For this project, we have queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
For assistance in the queries, the schema for the DVD Rental database was used as given in the dvd-rental-erd.pdf.

# Questions which we work on for analysis
Question 1

We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

Question 2

Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. 
Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

Question 3

Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. 
The resulting table should have three columns:

Category,
Rental length category,
Count

Question 4

We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for.
Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. 
Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.
